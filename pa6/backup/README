==========================================

This program creates the BigIntegerAdt in C++, use this capable of performing arithmetic operations on arbitrarily large signed integers. The underlying data structure for this ADT will be a List of longs.
==========================================

1) Run "make", to get the executuable "Arithmetic"
2) Run "./Arithmetic <input file> <output file>"
